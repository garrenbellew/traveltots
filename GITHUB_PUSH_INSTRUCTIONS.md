# GitHub Push Instructions

Your repository is ready to push! Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `TravelTots`
3. Description: "Travel Tots - Child Essentials Rental Website"
4. Set visibility: **Private** (recommended)
5. **Do NOT** check "Add a README" or any other options
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push the Code

After creating the repository, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/gbellew/TravelTots
git push -u origin main
```

You'll be prompted for your GitHub credentials:
- **Username**: `gbellew_sfemu`
- **Password**: You'll need a Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

### Creating a Personal Access Token

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Note: "travel-tots-push"
4. Select scopes: Check `repo` (all sub-options)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

### Alternative: Use SSH (easier for future pushes)

If you have SSH keys set up with GitHub:

```bash
cd /Users/gbellew/TravelTots
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:gbellew_sfemu/TravelTots.git
git push -u origin main
```

## What's Already Done

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ All files committed (2 commits)
✅ Remote origin configured
✅ Branch renamed to `main`
✅ .gitignore created
✅ Deployment files created
✅ Ready to push!

## Next Steps After Pushing
