## Technical Debt

1. **Authentication**: Currently using localStorage for admin sessions. Should implement proper NextAuth with sessions.
2. **2FA**: Schema supports 2FA but UI and logic need implementation.
3. **Email**: Using Nodemailer directly. Consider EmailJS or dedicated service.
4. **Image Uploads**: Product images need upload handling.
5. **Error Handling**: Needs more comprehensive error boundaries.
6. **Testing**: No unit or integration tests yet.
7. **Performance**: Consider adding caching layer (Redis).
8. **Security**: Needs rate limiting on API routes.

## Known Limitations

1. SQLite is used for development. Must migrate to PostgreSQL/MySQL for production.
2. Image upload functionality requires file storage setup (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.).
3. Email notifications require SMTP configuration.
4. Admin dashboard needs more CRUD interfaces.
5. No pagination on product/order lists yet.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Production)
1. Implement full admin order management UI
2. Add product management CRUD interface
3. Set up proper authentication with NextAuth
4. Configure production database (PostgreSQL)
5. Add image upload functionality
6. Implement proper error handling
7. Add loading states throughout

### Short Term
1. Complete admin calendar view
2. Add email templates
3. Implement 2FA for admin
4. Add pagination to lists
5. Create comprehensive admin help documentation
6. Add SEO meta tags

### Medium Term
1. Add customer account system
2. Implement payment gateway
3. Add Spanish language support
4. Create mobile app
5. Add analytics tracking

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Copy environment variables
4. Run `npx prisma generate && npx prisma db push`
5. Seed database: `npx tsx scripts/seed.ts`
6. Run `npm run dev`

See `SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.
