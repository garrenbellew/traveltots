# Cloudinary Setup Guide

To enable mobile image uploads that work on Render, you need to set up a free Cloudinary account.

## Step 1: Create Free Cloudinary Account

1. Go to https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email

## Step 2: Get Your API Credentials

1. After logging in, you'll see your **Cloud name**
2. Click on the dashboard
3. You'll see your:
   - **API Key**
   - **API Secret** (keep this secret!)

## Step 3: Add to Render

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click on your `travel-tots` web service
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add these three environment variables:

```
Name: CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
Value: (your cloud name from step 2)

Name: CLOUDINARY_API_KEY  
Value: (your API key from step 2)

Name: CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
Value: (your API secret from step 2)
```

5. Click **Save Changes**
6. Render will automatically redeploy with the new settings

## What This Gives You

‚úÖ Upload images directly from your phone  
‚úÖ Images stored in the cloud (won't get deleted)  
‚úÖ Works on Render  
‚úÖ Free tier includes 25GB storage and 25GB bandwidth per month

## Testing

After adding the environment variables:
1. Wait for deployment to complete
2. Go to admin on your phone
3. Try uploading an image when creating a product
4. It should work! üéâ
